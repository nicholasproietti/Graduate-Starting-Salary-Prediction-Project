# Graduate Starting Salary Predictor
Using regression modules to predict the starting salaries of graduates

## Goal

The aim of this project is to build a regression model that predicts a graduate’s starting salary. The prediction is based on key factors derived from their education, skills, and extracurricular activities (e.g. GPA, university ranking, soft skills, internships). This was attempted using five regression methods and utilizing the best performing model.

## Dataset Description
